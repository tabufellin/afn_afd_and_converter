'''
@possible_ends

give an array of @states 
and a sign and it will give you all possible 
final answers

!!!!
you can think is the same as e_closure but
it will be a better option in the DFA because
it doesnt have any Epsilon value
!!!!

'''
@e_closure

does the same as move but the main difference
is that it will jump between epsilons and give the next
state that jumps until it stop finding epsilons
